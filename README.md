# solarAndLunarEclipsePredictor

This is a program which I made which tries to predict when solar and lunar eclipses will happen on earth. My model predicts for 2021, ![eclipsePredictionsfor2021](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37377528/120106536-4fb5c880-c12b-11eb-8651-eee1b385a260.png)
And compare this to what the actual dates are,

Which is highly accurate. And then to look at the specific times for, lets say, May 26, the actual times are

And for June 10th,

And lastly December 4th,

Admittedly, not all of the years I run through my model are always this accurate. One shortcoming of this program is that it does not model where the eclipse is seen on planet earth, as I was stuck on how to do this and plus I wanted to start learning how to program in the object-oriented paradigm, as I've realized my programs are incredibly messy and would be hard to follow for other eyes. I may come back to this and add it later, Im not sure.
