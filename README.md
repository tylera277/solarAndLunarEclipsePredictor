# Solar_and_Lunar_EclipsePredictor



This is a program which I made which predicts when solar and lunar eclipses will take place, as well as plotting the trajectory of solar eclipse's path across the surface of the Earth. 
- TO DOWNLOAD: Refer to the release side tab where I have given instructions on how to run this program yourself.
- The simple GUI I made is attached below.
